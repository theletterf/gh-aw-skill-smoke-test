# APM (Agent Package Manager) - Shared Workflow
# Install Microsoft APM packages in your agentic workflow.
#
# This shared workflow creates a dedicated "apm" job (depending on activation) that
# packs packages using microsoft/apm-action, caches the bundle for cross-run reuse,
# and uploads it as an artifact for reliable same-run access.
# The agent job restores from cache (preferred) or downloads the artifact as a fallback.

#         packages:
#           - microsoft/apm-sample-package

## APM Packages

These packages are installed via a dedicated "apm" job that packs the bundle, saves it to
cache for cross-run reuse, and uploads it as an artifact for reliable same-run access.
The agent job restores from cache (preferred) or falls back to downloading the artifact.

### How it works

1. **Pack** (`apm` job): checks for a cached bundle keyed by lock file hash + engine ID.
   On a cache miss, `microsoft/apm-action` installs packages and creates a bundle archive,
   which is saved to the cache and uploaded as an artifact.
   On a cache hit, the cached bundle is uploaded directly as an artifact.
2. **Unpack** (agent job pre-agent-steps): the bundle is restored from cache (preferred for
   speed and cross-run reuse) or downloaded from the artifact (reliable same-run fallback),
   then unpacked via `microsoft/apm-action` in restore mode.

### Cache key

The cache key is `apm-{engine_id}-{hash_of_lock_files}`, derived from:
- `needs.activation.outputs.engine_id` — the AI engine identifier (e.g. `copilot`, `claude`)
- `hashFiles('.github/workflows/*.lock.yml')` — hash of all compiled workflow lock files

This ensures the bundle is refreshed whenever the workflow configuration changes or the
engine changes, while being reused across runs with identical configuration.

### Package format

Packages use the format `owner/repo` or `owner/repo/path/to/skill`:
- `microsoft/apm-sample-package` — organization/repository
- `github/awesome-copilot/skills/review-and-refactor` — organization/repository/path

### Authentication

Packages are fetched using the cascading token fallback:
`GH_AW_PLUGINS_TOKEN || GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN || GITHUB_TOKEN`
